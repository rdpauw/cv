  abstract     = {{Objectives: Quantifying the combined impact of morbidity and mortality is a key enabler to assessing the impact of COVID-19 across countries and within countries relative to other diseases, regions, or demographics. Differences in methods, data sources, and definitions of mortality due to COVID-19 may hamper comparisons. We describe efforts to support countries in estimating the national-level burden of COVID-19 using disability-adjusted life years.

Methods: The European Burden of Disease Network developed a consensus methodology, as well as a range of capacity-building activities to support burden of COVID-19 studies. These activities have supported 11 national studies so far, with study periods between January 2020 and December 2021.

Results: National studies dealt with various data gaps and different assumptions were made to face knowledge gaps. Still, they delivered broadly comparable results that allow for interpretation of consistencies, as well as differences in the quantified direct health impact of the pandemic.

Discussion: Harmonized efforts and methodologies have allowed for comparable estimates and communication of results. Future studies should evaluate the impact of interventions, and unravel the indirect health impact of the COVID-19 crisis.}},

  abstract     = {{Background and aims: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major health care problem worldwide that comes together with physical and emotional burdens, resulting in substantial financial costs for society. Several treatment options are known for patients with chronic pain. Knowledge about predictive factors for therapy response is essential to refer the patient directly to the most efficient treatment program. This retrospective observational study strives to identify predictive factors for the change in disability after an interdisciplinary rehabilitation program.

Methods: A dataset of 653 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain who attended either a 10 or a 20-week interdisciplinary rehabilitation program at the Centre for Integral Rehabilitation (CIR) in four different outpatient care centers, in the Netherlands was analyzed. The therapy was personalized and consisted of pain neuroscience education, lifestyle education, coping strategies, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, graded activity, mental coaching and physical coaching, according to the needs of the patient. To assess the effect of the therapy on disability, the TampaPain Disability Index (PDI) was chosen as the outcome. The PDI was conducted at the screening (T0), after 10 weeks (T1), and after 20 weeks (T2) if the therapy continued. Questionnaires conducted at the screening were assessed as possible predictive factors: Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to assess fear of movement, Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) examined different aspects of fatigue,  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) evaluated different symptoms of depression, Utrecht’s Coping List (UCL) assessed the different coping strategies used by the participants and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) evaluated physical and psychological symptoms. The specific subcategories of the UCL and SCL-90 were also assessed individually. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used with the PDI as the dependent variable over time (screening, 10-week, 20-week). The model controlled for age, gender, treatment location and pain medication. The baseline questionnaires were separately added to the GLMM to analyze their possible predictive value. 

Results: The mean age of the population was 44.6 (± 11.9) years and consisted for 73% out of women. Most patients were treated in Amsterdam (28.9%). Pain medication was taken by 64.2%. No predictive value was found for the TSK, BDI, total UCL and total SCL-90 score at screening. However, significant interaction effects with ‘Time’ were found for the CIS (p<.05), subcategory ‘Expression of emotion’ of the UCL (p<.01) and subcategory ‘Hostility’ of the SCL-90 (p<.05). An increase in the CIS score of one point at T0, resulted in a greater decrease of the PDI score at T2 with 0.08 (95% CI = 0.01 – 0.14) compared with T0. Furthermore, an increase of one point in the subcategory ‘Expression of emotion’ of the UCL at T0 resulted in a greater decrease of the PDI score at T2 with 1.10 (95% CI = 0.34 – 1.86) compared with T0. Lastly, the PDI score decreased by 0.50 points (95% CI = 0.10 – 0.90) more at T2 compared to T0, for every one point increment in the subcategory ‘Hostility’ of the SCL-90 at T0. It is noteworthy that the change in PDI from screening towards the end of the therapy exceeded the minimal clinically important change value. 

Conclusions: Patients who experience more severe fatigue, who demonstrate more annoyance or anger, and who show more signs of hostility prior to starting treatment are more likely to experience improvement in pain disability after an interdisciplinary treatment program.}},

  abstract     = {{Background Overweight and obesity are one of the most significant risk factors of the twenty-first century related to an increased risk in the occurrence of non-communicable diseases and associated increased healthcare costs. To estimate the future impact of overweight, the current study aimed to project the prevalence of overweight and obesity to the year 2030 in Belgium using a Bayesian age-period-cohort (APC) model, supporting policy planning. Methods Height and weight of 58,369 adults aged 18+ years, collected in six consecutive cross-sectional health interview surveys between 1997 and 2018, were evaluated. Criteria used for overweight and obesity were defined as body mass index (BMI) >= 25, and BMI >= 30. Past trends and projections were estimated with a Bayesian hierarchical APC model. Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased between 1997 and 2018 in both men and women, whereby the highest prevalence was observed in the middle-aged group. It is likely that a further increase in the prevalence of obesity will be seen by 2030 with a probability of 84.1% for an increase in cases among men and 56.0% for an increase in cases among women. For overweight, it is likely to see an increase in cases in women (57.4%), while a steady state in cases among men is likely. A prevalence of 52.3% [21.2%; 83.2%] for overweight, and 27.6% [9.9%; 57.4%] for obesity will likely be achieved in 2030 among men. Among women, a prevalence of 49,1% [7,3%; 90,9%] for overweight, and 17,2% [2,5%; 61,8%] for obesity is most likely. Conclusions Our projections show that the WHO target to halt obesity by 2025 will most likely not be achieved. There is an urgent necessity for policy makers to implement effective prevent policies and other strategies in people who are at risk for developing overweight and/or obesity.}},

  abstract     = {{Background The importance of assessing and monitoring the health status of a population has grown in the last decades. Consistent and high quality data on the morbidity and mortality impact of a disease represent the key element for this assessment. Being increasingly used in global and national burden of diseases (BoD) studies, the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is an indicator that combines healthy life years lost due to living with disease (Years Lived with Disability; YLD) and due to dying prematurely (Years of Life Lost; YLL). As a step towards a comprehensive national burden of disease study, this study aims to estimate the non-fatal burden of cancer in Belgium using national data. Methods We estimated the Belgian cancer burden from 2004 to 2019 in terms of YLD, using national population-based cancer registry data and international disease models. We developed a microsimulation model to translate incidence- into prevalence-based estimates, and used expert elicitation to integrate the long-term impact of increased disability due to surgical treatment. Results The age-standardized non-fatal burden of cancer increased from 2004 to 2019 by 6 and 3% respectively for incidence- and prevalence-based YLDs. In 2019, in Belgium, breast cancer had the highest morbidity impact among women, followed by colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancer. Among men, prostate cancer had the highest morbidity impact, followed by colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancer. Between 2004 and 2019, non-melanoma skin cancer significantly increased for both sexes in terms of age-standardized incidence-based YLD per 100,000, from 49 to 111 for men and from 15 to 44 for women. Important decreases were seen for colorectal cancer for both sexes in terms of age-standardized incidence-based YLD per 100,000, from 105 to 84 for men and from 66 to 58 for women. Conclusions Breast and prostate cancers represent the greatest proportion of cancer morbidity, while for both sexes the morbidity burden of skin cancer has shown an important increase from 2004 onwards. Integrating the current study in the Belgian national burden of disease study will allow monitoring of the burden of cancer over time, highlighting new trends and assessing the impact of public health policies.}},

  abstract     = {{Introduction: Migraine is conceptualized as a continuum, with at the one hand episodic migraine and at the other hand chronic migraine (CM) which is more frequent (1). Recent studies support the presence of central sensitization (CS) in migraine patients (2,3), but controversial evidence exists about where in the continuum exactly CS appears and which mechanisms are underlying. Therefore this study aims to determine the occurrence and mechanisms of CS within the migraine continuum.

Methods: Self-reported and psychophysiological data will be collected from 30 migraine patients and 30 healthy controls. Pain sensitivity will be evaluated using Quantitative Sensory Testing including mechanical and thermal thresholds. Pain facilitation and inhibition will be assessed by using respectively temporal summation and conditioned pain modulation paradigms. Assessments are performed unilateral at the painful side and interictally.

Results: Widespread pain and impaired pain facilitation and inhibition are expected to be more pronounced in patients with more migraine days (further along the continuum) than in those with less migraine days.

Discussion: This research will show whether signs of CS are present in migraine patients, where in the migraine continuum these symptoms are appearing, and whether impaired pain inhibition and/or facilitation underlie these symptoms.}},

  abstract     = {{Background In a context of decreasing resources and growing health needs, evidence-based health and care policies are essential. This study aims to assess the health trends in Belgium between 1990 and 2019, to compare the Belgian health status to that of the EU-15 countries, and to identify the main drivers in trends over time and country differences within the EU-15. Methods We extracted estimates from the GBD 2019 study via the GBD results tool and visualization tools. We compared the Belgian health status with 14 European Union comparator countries between 1990 and 2019, and decomposed the time trends and country differences into the unique contributions of the different underlying causes of death and disability. Results Life expectancy (LE) in Belgium improved significantly between 1990 and 2019 for both men and women. Belgium age-standardised mortality rates dropped significantly for men (-40%) and women (-33%) between 1990 and 2019. Overall, Belgium age-standardised disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates dropped by 23%. This decrease is mainly due to decreasing trends in age-standardised years of life lost (YLL) rates while age-standardised years lived with disability (YLD) rates remained stable. Compared to EU-15, Belgium's ranking in terms of age-standardised DALY rates worsened for both men and women in 2019. Self-harm and falls are major causes of disease burden, with DALY rates that are higher than in many other EU-15 countries, indicating a realistic potential for improvement. Lung cancer DALY rates remain worrisome for men, and even show an increasing trend for women. Increasing trends of headache disorders, drug use disorders, and diabetes, require further attention. Conclusion Non-communicable diseases remain the main contributors for health burden in Belgium, with disability accounting for an increasingly larger share of the disease burden. Despite considerable improvements, Belgium's ranking for DALYs decreased between 1990 and 2019 compared to the EU-15. This study identified priority causes of disease burden based on their contributions to current evolutions and EU-15 differences. Since many of these causes are considered to be avoidable, primary and secondary prevention are crucial elements for reducing the burden of disease on the healthcare system.}},

  abstract     = {{Background: Chronic pain affects 20 to 30% of the adult population worldwide and is consequently the leading cause of disability. Current developments in brain imaging technology are increasing the understanding of the pathophysiology of (chronic) pain and enabling the possibility to objectify pain. As a result, our view of the brain has evolved from a static organ to a dynamic organ that constitutes an adaptable network of linked regions. Graph theory has emerged as a framework to analyze such networks and can be applied to investigate a range of topological properties of both the functional and structural brain network or connectome, thus providing meaningful information about the organization of human brain networks. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether connectivity differs between chronic pain patients and healthy controls by integrating previous studies that performed graph analyses on structural or functional connectivity. A secondary aim was to determine whether graph measures correlate to clinical outcomes. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: Relevant articles were searched for in PubMed and Web of Science. These were screened against certain criteria and assessed for quality. Results: On a global level the transitivity, betweenness centrality, intramodular degree, and rich club organization differed between chronic pain patients and healthy controls, but the path length, modularity, degree, and (Hub Disruption Index [HDI] of) participation coefficient did not differ between both groups, along with the small-worldness. Conflicting evidence still remains about a number of global graph measures, namely the global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and HDI of degree. Significant correlations were found between several nodal and global graph measures on one hand, and clinical outcomes related to pain, disability, and motor control on the other hand. Limitations: No clear conclusions could be made about the majority of the nodal measures, as they were often based on single studies. Conclusion: Differences between chronic pain patients and healthy controls were mostly observed for the global graph measures. Future research is still needed to validate the obtained findings and to expand this knowledge to the chronic pain populations that were not discussed in the included papers.}},

  abstract     = {Background: The spread of COVID-19 has affected people’s daily lives, and the lockdown may have led to a
disruption of daily activities and a decrease of people’s mental health.
Aim: To identify correlates of adults’ mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium and to assess the
role of meaningful activities in particular.
Methods: A cross-sectional web survey for assessing mental health (General Health Questionnaire), resilience
(Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), meaning in activities (Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey), and
demographics was conducted during the first Belgian lockdown between April 24 and May 4, 2020. The lockdown
consisted of closing schools, non-essential shops, and recreational settings, employees worked from home or were
technically unemployed, and it was forbidden to undertake social activities. Every adult who had access to the
internet and lived in Belgium could participate in the survey; respondents were recruited online through social
media and e-mails. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify key correlates.
Results: Participants (N = 1781) reported low mental health (M = 14.85/36). In total, 42.4% of the variance in mental
health could be explained by variables such as gender, having children, living space, marital status, health
condition, and resilience (β = −.33). Loss of meaningful activities was strongly related to mental health (β = −.36)
and explained 9% incremental variance (R2 change = .092, p < .001) above control variables.
Conclusions: The extent of performing meaningful activities during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium was
positively related to adults’ mental health. Insights from this study can be taken into account during future
lockdown measures in case of pandemics.},

  abstract     = {Background: Patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (CWAD) are characterized by pain of traumatic origin, cognitive deficits, and central sensitization (CS). Previous neuroimaging studies revealed altered grey matter volume (GMV) in mild traumatic brain injury patients and chronic pain conditions also characterized by CS. It can therefore be hypothesized that GMV alterations also play a role in the persistent complaints of CWAD. However, brain alterations remain poorly investigated in these patients. 
Objectives: This study examined regional GMV alterations in patients with CWAD compared to patients with non-traumatic chronic idiopathic neck pain (CINP), who normally do not show CS at a group level, and healthy controls. Additionally, in both patient groups, relationships between regional GMV and measures of cognition as well as pain processing were assessed. 
Study Design: A cross-sectional case-control study. 
Setting: This study was performed at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy of Ghent University in cooperation with the Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging. 
Methods: Ninety-three women (28 healthy controls, 34 CINP patients, and 31 CWAD patients) were enrolled. First, T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were acquired to examine GMV alterations in the brain regions involved in processing cognition and pain. Next, cognitive performance, pain cognitions, and CS symptoms were assessed. Finally, hyperalgesia and conditioned pain modulation efficacy were examined. 
Results: Regional GMV of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, left supramarginal cortex, and left posterior cingulate cortex was decreased in CWAD patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.023; P = 0.012; P = 0.047, respectively). Additionally, GMV of the right superior parietal cortex and left posterior cingulate cortex was decreased in CWAD patients compared to CINP patients (P = 0.008; P = 0.035, respectively). Decreased regional GMV correlated with worse cognitive performance, higher maladapted pain cognitions, CS symptoms, and hyperalgesia in CWAD patients (r(s) = -0.515 to -0.657; P < 0.01). In CINP patients, decreased regional GMV correlated only with worse cognitive performance (r(s) = -0.499 to -0.619; P < 0.01), and no GMV differences compared with the controls could be revealed. 
Limitations: No conclusions about the causality of the observed relationships can be drawn. 
Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence for reduced GMV in cortical regions involved in processing cognition and pain in patients with CWAD. Accordingly, it is recommended that therapy approaches for CWAD patients should address the brain and take into account neuroplasticity of the central nervous system (CNS).},

  abstract     = {Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is characterized by maladaptive central neuroplastic changes. Many observational studies have demonstrated that chronic pain states are associated with brain alterations regarding structure and/or function. Rehabilitation of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain may include cognitive, exercise, or multimodal therapies. 
Objective: The current review aims to provide a constructive overview of the existing literature reporting neural correlates, based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, following conservative treatment in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients. 
Study Design: Systematic review of the literature. 
Methods: The current review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Literature was searched from 3 databases and screened for eligibility. Methodological quality across studies was assessed with Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence was determined applying the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 
Results: A total of 9 eligible studies were identified with a predominant high risk of bias. Cognitive behavioral therapy induced several structural and functional changes predominantly in prefrontal cortical regions and a shift from affective to sensory-discriminative brain activity after behavioral extinction training. Multidisciplinary treatment in pediatric complex regional pain syndrome facilitated normalization of functional connectivity of resting-state networks and the amygdala, and increased gray matter in prefrontal and specific subcortical areas. Exercise therapy led to specific for resting-state functional connectivity and a trend towards pressure-induced brain activity changes. 
Limitations: A very small number of studies was available, which furthermore exhibited small study samples. Moreover, only 2 of the included studies were randomized controlled trials. 
Conclusions: It is likely that conservative treatments may induce mainly functional and structural brain changes in prefrontal regions in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Due to the relatively high risk of bias across the included studies, future studies with randomized designs are needed to confirm the current findings. In addition, more research evaluating.},

  abstract     = {Background: Chronic neck pain affects 50% - 85% of people who have experienced an acute episode. This transition and the persistence of chronic complaints are believed to be mediated by brain alterations among different central mechanisms. 
Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the current existing evidence regarding structural and functional brain alterations in patients with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and idiopathic neck pain (INP). Additionally, associations between brain alterations and clinical symptoms reported in neck pain patients were evaluated. 
Study Design: Systematic review. 
Methods: The present systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched. First, the obtained articles were screened based on title and abstract. Secondly, the screening was based on the full text. Risk of bias in included studies was investigated. 
Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Alterations in brain morphology and function, including perfusion, neurotransmission, and blood oxygenation level dependent-signal, were demonstrated in chronic neck pain patients. There is some to moderate evidence for both structural and functional brain alterations in patients with chronic neck pain. In contrast, no evidence for structural brain alterations in acute neck pain patients was found. 
Limitations: Only 12 articles were included, which allows only cautious conclusions to be drawn. 
Conclusion: Brain alterations were observed in both patients with chronic WAD and chronic INP. Furthermore, more evidence exists for brain alterations in chronic WAD, and different underlying mechanisms might be present in both pathologies. In addition, pain and disability were correlated with the observed brain alterations. Accordingly, morphological and functional brain alterations should be further investigated in patients with chronic WAD and chronic INP with newer and more sensitive techniques, and associative clinical measurements seem indispensable in future research.},
